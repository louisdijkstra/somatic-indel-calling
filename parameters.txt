# This file contains the parameter settings used throughout the process
# of calling somatic mutations. Please, make sure that this file is located
# in the main directory of the repository and bears the name 'parameters.txt'
# 
# The options/parameters that can be set for running the programs in this 
# project are numerous. Here, we only concern us with the parameters most 
# relevant for the TCGA Dream Challenge. The default values are used for
# the other parameters/options.  
#
# Every line in this file that starts with a # or is empty is ignored. 
# Lines that specify the parameter values start with $ and are 
# of the following form: 
#
# 	$<parameter_indicator> = <value>

# Parameters for observation extraction 
# -------------------------------------
#
# The parameters used for extracting observations with 
# 'extract-observations.py'. 
#
# 1. The alinger that was used (can be 'laser' or 'bwa'). 
$ALIGNER = bwa
# 
# Parameters for calling 
# ----------------------
#
# 2. Level of impurity of the cancer sample, i.e., the percentage of cells
# in the tumour sample that are actually healthy: 
$ALPHA = 0.20 
#
# 3. Probability of observing an overlapping alignment without a split when
# a deletion is present: 
$EPS_P_DEL = 0.0340
#
# 4. Probability of observing an overlapping alignment without a split when 
# an insertion is present: 
$EPS_P_INS = 0.2126 
#
# 5. Probability of observing an alignment with a split when no deletion or 
# insertion is present: 
$EPS_A = 0.0001 
#
# (Parameters 3,4 and 5 are estimated on the basis of simulated data.) 
#
# 6. Variants are called either 'somatic' or 'not somatic' on the basis of 
# their posterior probabilities. This is done is such a way that the posterior
# expected F_beta score (a weighted harmonic mean of the recall and 
# precision) is maximized. The beta here reflects how much more important
# recall is than precision. Common values of beta are 1/2, 1 and 2. 
$BETA = 1.0
